.. cpp:class:: LocalAssembler

    Assembly of local cell tensors. Used by the adaptivity and
    LocalSolver functionality in dolfin. The local assembly
    functionality provided here is also wrapped as a free function
    assemble_local(form_a, cell) in Python for easier usage. Use
    from the C++ interface defined below will be faster than the
    free function as fewer objects need to be created and destroyed.


    .. cpp:function:: static void assemble(Eigen::Matrix<double, Eigen::Dynamic, Eigen::Dynamic, )
    
        Assemble a local tensor on a cell. Internally calls
        assemble_cell(), assemble_exterior_facet(),
        assemble_interior_facet().
        < [out] The tensor to assemble.

    .. cpp:function:: static void assemble_cell(Eigen::Matrix<double, Eigen::Dynamic, Eigen::Dynamic, )
    
        Worker method called by assemble() to perform assembly of
        volume integrals (UFL measure dx).
        < [out] The tensor to assemble.

    .. cpp:function:: static void assemble_exterior_facet(Eigen::Matrix<double, Eigen::Dynamic, Eigen::Dynamic, )
    
        Worker method called by assemble() for each of the cell's
        external facets to perform assembly of external facet
        integrals (UFL measure ds).
        < [out] The tensor to assemble.

    .. cpp:function:: static void assemble_interior_facet(Eigen::Matrix<double, Eigen::Dynamic, Eigen::Dynamic, )
    
        Worker method called by assemble() for each of the cell's
        internal facets to perform assembly of internal facet
        integrals (UFL measure dS)
