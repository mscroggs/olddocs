.. cpp:class:: NonlinearProblem

    This is a base class for nonlinear problems which can return the
    nonlinear function F(u) and its Jacobian J = dF(u)/du.


    .. cpp:function:: NonlinearProblem()
    
        Constructor


    .. cpp:function:: void form(GenericMatrix& A, GenericVector& b, const GenericVector& x)
    
        Function called by Newton solver before requesting F or J.
        This can be used to compute F and J together.
        NOTE: This function is deprecated. Use variant with
        preconditioner


    .. cpp:function:: void form(GenericMatrix& A, GenericMatrix& P, GenericVector& b, const GenericVector& x)
    
        Function called by Newton solver before requesting F, J or J_pc.
        This can be used to compute F, J and J_pc together. Preconditioner
        matrix P can be left empty so that A is used instead


    .. cpp:function:: void F(GenericVector& b, const GenericVector& x) = 0
    
        Compute F at current point x


    .. cpp:function:: void J(GenericMatrix& A, const GenericVector& x) = 0
    
        Compute J = F' at current point x


    .. cpp:function:: void J_pc(GenericMatrix& P, const GenericVector& x)
    
        Compute J_pc used to precondition J. Not implementing this
        or leaving P empty results in system matrix A being used
        to construct preconditioner.
        
        Note that if nonempty P is not assembled on first call
        then a solver implementation may throw away P and not
        call this routine ever again.
